synchronous programming vs asynchronous programming
01 synchronous programming - javascript is synchronous programming single threaded - asynchronous programming multi threaded - asynchronous programming is faster than synchronous programming


setTimeout
- setTimeout provided and handle by web browser.
- setTimeout is used to execute a function after a specified time period

example
- Fetching backend data having some time so it can be blocking code.
- so we used asynchronous in javascript.

02 setInterval - setInterval is used to execute a function at specified time interval. - it is used to create a loop in javascript. - it handle by web API provided by Browser.

Example
changing background color of body and stop changing button can stop it.
take a random color code and set interval for changing the background color.
